# Miscellaneous Scripts

A collection of computational scripts for bioinformatics analysis, primarily focused on protein structure analysis and computational biology workflows.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains various scripts and utilities that I've developed and use in my computational biology work. These tools are particularly relevant for the Rosetta Commons community and researchers working in computational structural biology.

## 🛠️ Scripts

### Structure Analysis
- **structure_analyse_binder.py**: Analysis tool for protein-protein interactions and binding interfaces
  - Purpose: Analyse binder-target complex (1 binder, 1-n targets) and get various scores, e.g. secondary structure, surface area, shape complementarity, etc.
  - Usage: `structure_analyse.py [-h] --pdb PDB --binder_chain BINDER_CHAIN --target_chains TARGET_CHAINS [--fixed_residues FIXED_RESIDUES] [--write_output]`


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
